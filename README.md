# School-Shooting-Analysis

  The project will be centered around analyzing the statistics on school shootings to determine if there are any major trends that could cause an increase or decrease in school shootings over a 30 year period, starting from 1990 to Present. The data is linked below

  The visualization that we wish to come up with are an interactive map of the the USA that shows us
  the location of a shooting event, as well as the description of that shooting. We also plan
  on creating interactive graphs that compares data such as poverty rate, crime rates and many other 
  factors and compare it against various statistics in school shootings.
  
  Summary: From the analysis, it looks like that most of the shootings occur in highly-populated areas and states such as California, Texas and Florida. While this is one metric
  This pushes us into a direction where we can possibly look at other avenues. For example we can ask the following questions for deeper investigations "What is it about   population density that increases this incident?", "what characteristics are common among populated areas that may contribute to high shooting cases?" By answering these deeper questions, we can go into more deoth as to how we can shape policies to prevent a national crisis, and we believe that this is the first step.

Additional Data findings are published on Tablaeu, where we also visualized the shooting incidents by School Type (elementary, middle, etc.) and found additional data on guns owned. Link is below
