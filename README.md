  Visualization that we wish to come up with are an interactive map of the the USA that shows us
  the location of a shooting event, as well as the description of that shooting. We also plan
  on creating interactive graphs that compares data such as poverty rate, crime rates and many other 
  factors and compare it against various statistics in school shootings.
