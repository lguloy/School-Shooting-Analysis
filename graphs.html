          <div><h3 style="color: white;">Summary:</h3><p style="font-size: medium; color: white;">As you can see from the graphs, 
            the number of school shootings has trended upwards over the years. Weâ€™ve broken down the total number of shootings per year 
            and grouped them by area of occurrence. The data set we are using did not have school type for each incident, but you can surmise
            from the data where shootings are most frequent. We also break down total shootings by state to better see which states 
            have seen the most shootings in the past 30 years.We hope that by presenting this data in this manner, 
            others can see where gun violence is most prevalent, and measures can be taken to help curb more violence in the future</p></div>
          <div><h3 style="color: white;">Total Shootings:</h3><p style="font-size: medium; color: white;">
            From the total shootings graph, we can see that there has been in incidents from 2005-2015, however it has dropped since then.
            However we cannot conclude too much from this data without looking at different factors. As such we looked at incidents at
            different area types and by state </p></div>
          <div><h3 style="color: white;">Area Type Shootings:</h3><p style="font-size: medium; color: white;">
            In this data, we seperated each incidents in each year by an area type: Urban, Suburban and Rural. From this trend
            We can see that a high amount of incidents happen in urban areas, such as cities. We can also
            make the observation that rural areas are not as likely to have these kind of incidents We can show this further when we look 
            at the visualization that groups these incidents by state </p></div>
          <div><h3 style="color: white">Total Shootings Per State:</h3><p style="font-size: medium; color: white;">As mentioned about the area
            type shootings, we concluded that most shootings occur in urban areas. We can further solidify this conclusion with state groupings. In the bar chart,
            We can see that California (despite its policies on gun control) have the highest shooting frequency, followed by Texas and Florida. These states
            tend to have areas of high population density such as San Francisco, Miami, Dallas and etc. If density or population has to do something
            with this trend, then factors that have a trend with population density (such as poverty rates, cost of living, etc.) have an effect on frequency </p></div>
          <div><h3 style="color: white">A Deeper Look:</h3><p style="font-size: medium; color: white;">While the analysis only analyzes area types,
            it opens avenues to look at more deeply. For example, we can ask more questions such as "does poverty have to do anything about it?" or 
            "do policies have more an effect on the incidents". Future studies can also delve into why there was a spike in the periods of 1990-1995 
            and 2005-2015. We can ask ourselves what events may have caused these spikes, which can allow us to better put action into preventing
            school shootings. </p></div>
            <div><h3 style="color: white">Other Considerations</h3><p style="font-size: medium; color: white;">While we have anlyzed data from 
            the number of incidents per area type, it is important to consider a few things about the data set that we gethered</p>

            <ul h3 style="color: white">
              <li>What counts as a shooting incident?</li>
              <li>What about non-school related incidents?</li>
              <li>How did the author of the CSV clean it</li>
              <li>Maybe a few spots that we may have missed in cleaning</li>
            </ul>
